## Introduction

The Waste Management System with IoT Integration proposes an innovative approach to enhance waste bin efficiency using IoT technology. The system incorporates level indicating sensors integrated with Wi-Fi modules into waste bins. These interconnected bins are connected to a central microcontroller, forming a network for data collection and analysis. A dedicated web portal, the Coordination Controller, accumulates data from all the bins online. A pre-fed algorithm in the Coordination Controller identifies areas requiring immediate attention based on detritus levels. GPS-enabled trucks equipped with App-enabled PDAs receive notifications for immediate waste collection in critical areas, prioritized based on a predefined algorithm.

## Key Features

- Automated system utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time data processing and feedback.
- Default alert notifications sent to assigned controllers or truck drivers via App when the bin reaches a specified marginal level.
- Proximity sensors outside the bins trigger buzzer sounds when trash is placed outside, prompting users to throw it inside the bin.

## Benefits

- Efficient waste management with regular and timely collections.
- Prevention of littering and waste overflow.
- High-priority attention to areas like schools and hospitals for maintaining cleanliness.
- Centralized monitoring and control system accessible from anywhere in the world.

## Requirements

The system is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi computer with the following hardware and software requirements:

- Raspberry Pi 3 or 4
- Raspbian operating system
- Python 3
- Paho MQTT client library
- Adafruit DHT sensor library

## Installation

To install the system, clone the repository and install the required dependencies as specified in the README file.

## Usage

Once the system is installed, deploy the sensors in public spaces to start collecting data. The sensors will continuously monitor detritus levels and transmit the data to the central server. The generated reports can be utilized to make informed decisions regarding detritus management.

## Code Details

### atmega328.ino

This code is written for the Arduino Uno microcontroller and is responsible for collecting data from the DHT11 sensor and transmitting it to the Raspberry Pi. The code initializes the DHT11 sensor and continuously reads temperature and humidity values, formatting them as JSON data transmitted to the Raspberry Pi using the MQTT protocol.

### python.py

This Python code is written for the Raspberry Pi and receives data from the Arduino Uno to store it in a database. The code connects to the MQTT broker, subscribes to the topic where the Arduino Uno publishes data, parses the JSON data, and stores the temperature and humidity values in the database.

The two codes work together to collect data from the DHT11 sensor and store it in a database, forming the foundation for generating insightful reports on detritus levels and trends.

### Additional Details

#### atmega328.ino

- Written in the Arduino programming language.
- Utilizes the DHT11 sensor library to read temperature and humidity values.
- Implements the MQTT library to transmit data to the Raspberry Pi.

#### python.py

- Written in the Python programming language.
- Utilizes the Paho MQTT client library to connect to the MQTT broker.
- Utilizes the JSON library to parse data received from the Arduino Uno.
- Uses the sqlite3 library to store data in a database.

The integration of microcontrollers, Wi-Fi modules, and sensors in this project revolutionizes waste management. The IoT-enabled system ensures efficient waste collection, cleanliness, and resource optimization, making a significant impact on environmental sustainability. The open-source nature of the project allows for contributions and adaptations to suit specific requirements, offering an ideal solution for waste management challenges in various settings.
